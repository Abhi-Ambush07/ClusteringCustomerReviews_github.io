1. Data Collection
•	Gather relevant data: Collect data that is pertinent to the problem you're trying to solve.
•	Ensure data quality: Verify data accuracy, completeness, and consistency.
•	Consider data quantity: Sufficient data is crucial for model training.
2. Data Pre-processing
•	Clean data: Handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
•	Feature engineering: Create new features from existing ones to improve model performance.
•	Data normalization: Scale data to a common range to avoid bias.
•	Split data: Divide data into training, validation, and testing sets.
3. Choose a Model
•	Understand the problem: Determine if it's a classification, regression, clustering, or other type of problem.
•	Select algorithms: Choose appropriate algorithms based on the problem type and data characteristics.
•	Consider model complexity: Balance model complexity with interpretability.
4. Train the Model
•	Feed data: Provide the training data to the model.
•	Learn patterns: The model identifies patterns and relationships in the data.
•	Iterative process: Adjust parameters and hyper parameters to improve performance.
5. Evaluate the Model
•	Use validation set: Assess model performance on unseen data.
•	Calculate metrics: Employ relevant metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, etc.) based on the problem.
•	Compare models: Evaluate multiple models to select the best one.
6. Fine-tune and Optimize
•	Hyper parameter tuning: Experiment with different hyper parameter values.
•	Regularization: Prevent overfitting by adding a penalty term to the loss function.
•	Ensemble methods: Combine multiple models to improve performance.
7. Deploy the Model
•	Choose a platform: Select a suitable deployment environment (cloud, on-premises, etc.).
•	Integrate with systems: Connect the model to other applications or systems.
•	Monitor performance: Continuously track model performance and retrain as needed.

CLUSTERING CUSTOMER REVIEWS FOR MARKET RESEARCH
Clustering customer reviews is a powerful technique to uncover hidden patterns and insights from vast amounts of textual data. By grouping similar reviews together, businesses can identify common themes, strengths, weaknesses, and areas for improvement. 
Beyond the general benefits, clustering customer reviews can be applied in various domains. Prioritize customer issues based on cluster frequency and sentiment. Identify areas for improvement and innovation based on common complaints or feature requests. Understand customer segments and preferences for targeted marketing campaigns. Monitor brand sentiment and identify potential crises early on.

1. Data Collection:
Gather customer reviews with product name, rating and reviews from the internet. I’ve used the following dataset ‘https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/niraliivaghani/flipkart-product-customer-reviews-dataset’.Data is contained with the headings of product_name, product_price, rate, review, summary and sentiment.
2. Data Pre-processing: Clean the data, handle missing values, and ensure that all features are in a suitable format for analysis. Fill Not a Number values with both forward fill and drop null values. Remove punctuations from the reviews and summary. Convert values inside the column ‘Sentiment’ into numeric values and ‘Summary’ and ‘Review’ data into TF-IDF vectors.
3. Feature Selection: Choose relevant features that might have a linear relationship with the reviews. Perform exploratory data analysis to identify important features, such as ‘Sentiment’ and ‘Rating’.
4. Train-Test Split: Split the data into a training set and a testing set. The training set will be used to train the model, while the testing set will be used to evaluate its performance.
5. Model Training: Apply Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to the training data. Then apply K-Means to this data checking for accuracy for best suit.
6. Model Evaluation: Use the testing set to evaluate the performance of the PCA  and K-Means model. We used Davies-Bouldin and Silhouette-scores to evaluate the accuracy of our clusters.
7. Model Optimization: Depending on the results, you might need to adjust the feature selection, consider non-linear relationships, or try other cluster models if K-Means and PCA doesn't perform well.
